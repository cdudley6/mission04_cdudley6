    <p>
        In IS 413, I hope to get to a level of programming that will let me feel confortable in a strongly typed language to make many of the programs that I may want to make.  I would
        also like to get better at many of the important coding principles like Object Oriented Programming.  If by the end of this class I am very confortable with C#, I will consider it a success and
        will have gotten most of everything I wanted to get out of this class.
